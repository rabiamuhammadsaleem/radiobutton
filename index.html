        <h2>ONSIDE EDUCATION:</h2>
        <br>
        <center>A relationship between the teacher and the student; In a classroom, learners and teachers can
            spend more in-person time together</center>
            <br>
            <li>Onside learning requires you to travel to
                a classroom location and arrive on time.</li>
            <br>    
            <li>In-person schooling is not as flexible as virtual learning. A teacher has a strict schedule to follow, which
                leaves less time for individualized student support when required. Moreover, the cost to teach in-person is
                higher than virtual learning due to the increased need for supplies.

                If a computer or a user is connected to the Internet, it is said to be "online" A website,
            for example, is online, because it is on the Internet.
             </center> 
             <br>
             <li> online learning, you can study anytime and anywhere, even in the comfort of your own home.</li> 
             <BR>
            <li> When studying online, youâ€™re dependent on access to the internet. Technical difficulties such as internet
                connectivity issues, software compatibility issues, or issues with your laptop, can hinder your ability to
                access classes.</li>
                <br>
             <center>onsite education is more preferable than online learning as it provides unlimited one-on-one interaction
                opportunities which enhance students' social and professional skills.</center>
